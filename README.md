##Contributing
1. Add (aka stage) your changes to the local git repository index

    ```git add -A```

2. Commit your changes to the repository (akin to 'saving') with a commit message

    ```git commit -m "this is the message which will be applied to this commit"```

3. Push your changes to the remote git repository (hosted on Bitbucket)

    ```git push```

4. To Pull changes from the Bitbucket remote repository and sync with your local git repository (ie. to get changes
made by other contributors)

    ```git pull```

These commands can all be accomplished via the [Intellij GUI](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/using-git-integration.html) 
(or [Sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/))
